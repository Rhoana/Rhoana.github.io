          In the field of connectomics, neuroscientists acquire electron microscopy volumes at nanometer resolution in
          order to reconstruct a detailed wiring diagram of the neurons in the brain. The resulting image volumes, which
          often are hundreds of terabytes in size, need to be segmented to identify cell boundaries, synapses, and
          important cell organelles. However, the segmentation process of a single volume is very complex, time-intensive,
          and usually performed using a diverse set of tools and many users. To tackle the associated challenges, this
          paper presents NeuroBlocks, which is a novel visualization system for tracking the state, progress, and
          evolution of very large volumetric segmentation data in neuroscience. NeuroBlocks is a multi-user web-based
          application that seamlessly integrates the diverse set of tools that neuroscientists currently use for manual
          and semi-automatic segmentation, proofreading, visualization, and analysis. NeuroBlocks is the first system
          that integrates this heterogeneous tool set, providing crucial support for the management, provenance,
          accountability, and auditing of large-scale segmentations. We describe the design of NeuroBlocks, starting
          with an analysis of the domain-specific tasks, their inherent challenges, and our subsequent task abstraction
          and visual representation. We demonstrate the utility of our design based on two case studies that focus on
          different user roles and their respective requirements for performing and tracking the progress of segmentation
          and proofreading in a large real-world connectomics project.
