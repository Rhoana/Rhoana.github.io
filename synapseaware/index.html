        Reconstructed terabyte and petabyte electron microscopy image volumes contain fully-segmented neurons at resolutions fine enough to identify every synaptic connection. After manual or automatic reconstruction, neuroscientists want to extract wiring diagrams and connectivity information to analyze the data at a higher level. Although researchers have made big advances in image acquisition, neuron segmentation, and synapse detection techniques, the extracted wiring diagrams are still quite coarse, and often do not take into account a wealth of information in the densely reconstructed volumes. At the same time, theoretical neuroscientists predict voltage changes across cells by numerically solving a series of differential equations given by cable theory. However, their models currently operate on artificially generated neurons because of a dearth of detailed and accurate connectivity data. We propose a synapse-aware skeleton generation strategy to transform the reconstructed volumes into an information-rich yet abstract format on which neuroscientists can perform biological analysis and run simulations. We demonstrate our results on three large-scale connectomic datasets and compare against current state-of-the-art skeletonization algorithms.
